# Service Mesh

A service mesh is a service routing layer that provides advanced routing, security, and observability features. It is mainly concerned with east-west service routing, but some implementations can also handle north-south routing. 

Services in the mesh communicate with each other through proxies that augment the connection. The use of proxies makes meshes compelling, as they enhance workloads without changes to source code.
