    "You’ve learned about pods and how to deploy them through ReplicaSets and similar resources to ensure they keep running. Although certain pods can do their work independently of an external stimulus, many applications these days are meant to respond to external requests. For example, in the case of microservices, pods will usually respond to HTTP requests coming either from other pods inside the cluster or from clients outside the cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pods need a way of finding other pods if they want to consume the services they provide. Unlike in the non-Kubernetes world, where a sysadmin would configure each client app by specifying the exact IP address or hostname of the server providing the service in the client’s configuration files, doing the same in Kubernetes wouldn’t work, because\n",
    "- `Pods are ephemeral` — They may come and go at any time, whether it’s because a pod is removed from a node to make room for other pods, because someone scaled down the number of pods, or because a cluster node has failed.\n",
    "- `Kubernetes assigns an IP address to a pod after the pod has been scheduled to a node and before it’s started` — Clients thus can’t know the IP address of the server pod up front.\n",
    "- `Horizontal scaling means multiple pods may provide the same service` — Each of those pods has its own IP address. Clients shouldn’t care how many pods are backing the service and what their IPs are. They shouldn’t have to keep a list of all the individual IPs of pods. Instead, all those pods should be accessible through a single IP address.\n",

Clients can open connections to that IP and port, and those connections are then routed to one of the pods backing that service. This way, clients of a service don’t need to know the location of individual pods providing the service, allowing those pods to be moved around the cluster at any time."

Similarly, by also creating a service for the backend pod, you create a stable address for the backend pod. The service address doesn’t change even if the pod’s IP address changes. Additionally, by creating the service, you also enable the frontend pods to easily find the backend service by its name through either environment variables or DNS.
