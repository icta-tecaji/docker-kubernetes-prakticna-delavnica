The demo code is available in the Link Extractor repo. The code is organized in steps that incrementally introduce changes and new concepts. After completion, the application stack will contain the following microservices:\n",
    "- A web application written in PHP and served using Apache that takes a URL as the input and summarizes extracted links from it\n",
    "- The web application talks to an API server written in Python (and Ruby) that takes care of the link extraction and returns a JSON response\n",
